        <h1>How Maui Fished Up the North Island</h1><br><br>
        <h2>According to Maori history, the North Island of New Zealand is called Te Ika a Maui (Maui's Great Fish). Maui is the gifted demigod who appears in many Maori and Polynesian myths and legends, and his best achievement was fishing up New Zealand's
           North Island.<br></h2>
           <h2>The story goes that Maui's brothers weren't too fond of him, so they decided to go on a fishing trip without him. Maui heard them chatting and he secretly made a fishhook from a jawbone before hiding under the floorboards of his brothers' canoe.<br><br></h2>
           <h2>When the canoe was far offshore, Maui sprung out from under the floorboards and threw his fishhook over the side of the canoe. Maui felt the hook touch something, and he brought it in fast. With his brothers' help, they brought the fish up to land. Before he could appease Tangaroa, the god of the sea, his brothers were carving bits out of the fish. These are now the mountains, valleys, lakes and rocky shorelines of the North Island. The head of the fish is the bottom of the island, and the tail is the top.<br><br></h2
