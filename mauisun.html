        <h1><strong>How Maui Slowed the Sun</strong></h1>
        <h2>One evening, Māui and his brothers were preparing a hāngi for their evening meal. They had finished heating the stones when the sun went down quickly and it became too dark to see. Māui was annoyed with eating food in the dark, so he moved to the light of the fire and addressed his people.<br><br>"Every day we have to rush to do chores and gather our food before the sun sets. Why should we be slaves to the sun? I will catch the sun before it rises, and teach it to travel slowly across the sky!"<br><br>But his brothers were quick to criticise, not believing Māui could do such a thing.<br><br>"It would be impossible to catch the sun, it's bigger than any bird you've caught!"<br><br>"The heat and flames would definitely burn you to death," said another.<br><br>"I think he's got sunstroke," added another, and they all laughed at Māui.<br><br>When they had quieted down, Māui took the sacred jawbone of his ancestor and waved it in the air.<br><br>"I have acheived many things that were thought impossible - gaining fire from Mahuika, catching the greatest fish in the world, going to the underworld, and many more. With this magic jawbone, gifted by Murirangawhenua, and with your help, I will succeed in conquering the sun!"<br><br>Most of the people agreed that Māui had acheived great feats, so they decided to help him in his journey.<br><br>The next day, Māui got a lot of flax, and taught the people how to make flax rope, a skill he learnt when he was in the underworld.<br><br>During the night, Māui and his brothers arrived at the edge of a huge, hot pit, that was deep into the ground. Inside, the sun, Tamanuiterā, was sleeping. The brothers were silent, terrified of what will happen if he woke. Māui ordered his brothers to build four huts around the edges of the pit to hide their ropes. Māui and his brothers then spread the flax ropes into a noose, just finishing before dawn, when the sun was about to wake.<br><br>"When Tamanuiterā rises and his head and shoulders are in the noose, I will tell you to pull on the ropes." Māui told his brothers.<br><br>One of the brothers got scared and tried to run while he still could.<br><br>"Why are we doing this? It's madness!" said another.<br><br>"We'll get burned alive if we don't run now!"<br><br>Two brothers tried to sneak away, but Māui caught them with the corner of his eye.<br><br>"The sun is about to rise, if you run now, you'll be the first ones to die! There's no turning back now!"<br><br>The brothers had no time to answer, the sun was waking, and it was rising from the pit. They quickly ran to their huts and grabbed the ropes. Tamanuiterā slowly rose from the pit, not knowing there was a trap there for him. His head and shoulders went throught the noose. Māui jumped out of his hut and yelled at his brothers to pull on the ropes.<br><br>The brothers were scared, but Māui said "Quickly, if you take too long, you will be scorched!"<br><br>Then the sun looked down to the edges of the pit and saw Māui standing before him. Tamanuiterā was furious. He hurled a huge fireball at Māui, but Māui ducked, holding tightly to his rope.<br><br>The brothers jumped out from their huts and grabbed tight on their ropes before Tamanuiterā could escape.<br><br>"Aaarrrhhh" roared the sun in anger.<br><br>"Why are you doing this to me?" cried the sun.<br><br>"From now on you will travel slowly across the sky, never again will the length of the day be dictated by you." Māui replied.<br><br>The sun tried to struggle free, but Māui had the power of his magic jawbone. Māui then told his brothers to let go of their ropes. The sun travelled slowly into the sky, tired and beaten.<br><br>From that day, the sun has always travelled slowly across the sky.</h2>
