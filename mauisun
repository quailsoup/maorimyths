        <h1><strong>How Maui Slowed the Sun</strong></h1>
        <h2>One evening, Māui and his brothers were preparing a hāngi for their evening meal. They had finished heating the stones when the sun went down quickly and it became too dark to see. Māui was annoyed with eating food in the dark, so he moved to the light of the fire and addressed his people.<br><br>"Every day we have to rush to do our chores and gather our food before the sun sets. Why should we be slaves to the sun? I will catch the sun before it rises, and teach it to travel slowly across the sky!"<br><br>But his brothers were quick to criticise, not believing Māui could do such a thing.<br><br>"It would be impossible to catch the sun, it's bigger than any bird you've caught!"<br><br>"The heat and flames would definitely burn you to death," said another.<br><br>"I think he's got sunstroke," added another, and they all laughed at Māui.</h2>
