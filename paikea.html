        <h1>Paikea</h1><br><br>
       <h2>Paikea was Uenuku's favourite son. This made Paikea's brothers extremely jealous, and they conspired to kill him while fishing offshore and tell Uenuku he drowned. But the night before the fishing trip, Paikea didn't sleep and he overheard his brothers plotting.<br><br>The next day, when they were far out at sea, Paikea ruined their plan by purposely sinking the canoe and leaving his brothers to drown.<br>Paikea was now adrift in the sea, he clung to a plank from the canoe, and waited for his death. Then Tohorā the whale appeared and lifted Paikea on his back. Tohorā took Paikea to the settlement in New Zealand called Whangara, just north of Gisborne. Here, Paikea started a new life, and many years later one of Paikea's sons, Tahupotiki, traveled south and became the founder of the tribe Ngāi Tahu. </h2>
